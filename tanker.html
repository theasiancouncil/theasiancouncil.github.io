     <p>Here are a couple of tips and tricks that will help you and your team succeed when you're playing as a tanker.</p>
     <p>At the bottom of the pages, I'll show a few tips that I have for taking them out :)</p>

     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>This whole guide assume you are using the A7V Heavy assault tank version. Why because it is the best tank for team oriented gameplay. There are 3 versions of the A7V:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u2446-33">
      <li>Assault - High explosive primary gun and smoke screen</li>
     </ul>
     <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u2446-36">
      <li>Breakthrough - AT primary gun and supplies package</li>
     </ul>
     <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u2446-39">
      <li>Flamer - High explosive primary gun and gas grenade with flamethrower rear gunner seats</li>
     </ul>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>The Assault version is the one I use the most and recommend. The smoke screen cover your retreat and allow you to back away to repair in relative safety.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>The Breakthrough primary gun does more damage against enemy vehicles, but it has almost no splash damage and sucks against infantry. You'll get eaten by rocket guns for breakfast. The side guns are really good against infantry, but they require competent gunners. It also has only 4 seats instead of 6 for the other version, making it less useful as a mobile spawn point.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>The Flamer is good in close quarter map like Amiens. On other maps, not so much. The flamethrower give your position away from afar, and the lack of smoke screen is a weakness in open maps.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-51">DO NOT PICK LIGHT TANKS, I REPEAT DO NOT PICK LIGHT TANKS</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>I often see people using the Light Tank on the battlefield. Let me tell you why this is not a great idea:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u2446-58">
      <li>Light tanks are slower than heavy tanks</li>
     </ul>
     <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u2446-61">
      <li>Light tanks are weaker than heavy tanks</li>
     </ul>
     <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u2446-64">
      <li>You cannot spawn on light tanks</li>
     </ul>
     <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u2446-67">
      <li>No gunners</li>
     </ul>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>If you pick light tanks, you are at a disadvantage (unless you are really good with it to start with). You will be outgunned on the field. When you die, your team will have to deal with the enemy tanks while waiting for a new tank to spawn. When you are using a heavy tank, you act as a mobile spawn point, your team can spawn on you, exit the tank and help you. Light tanks are not teamplay oriented.</p>
     <p>Although light tanks are smaller and harder to spot than the huge heavy tanks, any competent team will realize your threat and will be able to take you out single handedly.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-82">Use the third person camera</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Third person camera is your friend. Use it as often as possible. You get a greater view of your vehicle and the threats that are closing in. Since the last patch, you can't always hit what you can see in third person, so remember switch the camera to first person when you're not sure if the shot will connect or not.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><span id="u2446-87">Do not push too far</span></p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Map knowledge is paramount when you're tanking. Always try to draw a virtual &quot;front line&quot; considering the points you have capped and the enemies cap. Ideally you should be a little behind this &quot;front line&quot;. You follow the infantry, trying to stay a little behind them. This gives you a better view of the field and you act as a mobile spawn point. This will also protect you from flanking. When playing, I often see tank rolling full speed into battle, only to get blown to bits a second later.</p>
     <p id="u2446-92">&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-94">Try not to get tunnel vision</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&quot;Oh I see that tank. You engage. You spam that left mouse button as fast as you can landing and receiving shots from the tank. Oh, two rockets guns joined the party, but that tank is almoooost down. I can get a last shot and get him. BOOM. You are dead. The enemy tank start repairing and is back to full strength in no time.&quot;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Tunnel vision is when you focus on a single tank / soldier / enemy vehicle. Your greatest strength on the battlefield is to know when you need to revert back to repair / reload. If you focus too hard on an enemy, you'll probably end out of position and dead.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-103">Shoot and scoot</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Your tank has 6 primary round. When those are expended, the reload process start. Firing during the reload process greatly increase the reload time. Why? Because the first shot has a greater reload delay than the others. If you always find yourself frantically clicking the left mouse button while waiting for ammo to magically appear in your tank, you're doing it wrong.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>That brings me to my point: *Shoot*, pop smoke, reverse to safety to *reload* and *repair*. Repeat. Enemy vehicles trying to follow you will get caught out of position and will be at a disadvantage.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>You can press the reload button twice to start the reload process manually instead of waiting for it to start automatically, gaining precious seconds.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>When retreating, smoke first, and start moving diagonally. If you retreat in a straight line, enemies will have an easier time correcting their aim to hit you. Also try if possible to have indestructible obstacles that you can hide behind near you. Use the terrain to your advantage.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-118">Spot and prioritize targets</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Q button, use it, abuse it. Not only you're helping the infantry and your gunners, but it will help you monitor the enemies coming at you.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Target priority:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>1. Tanks and assault player.</p>
     <p>2. Support players.</p>
     <p>3. Medics</p>
     <p>4. Light cars and motorcycles</p>
     <p>5. Snipers</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><span id="u2446-137">Learn the range of your primary weapon</span></p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>This one is easy. Learn the drop of your gun. Only practice will help you there. Try not to engage at extreme range unless you really need to. You will reveal your position, and waste ammo. Instead, spot the vehicle, get closer while monitoring the movement, and engage. Your target should be on the tip of you aiming reticle or inside the little triangle just below. The only exception is when engaging the enemy Artillery truck or AA truck. Firing from afar will force them to move to repair.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>You are also allowed to fire at pesky snipers hidden in the mountains IF there is not other target of priority closer.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><span id="u2446-146">Do not panic</span></p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Another one I see often. Tank gets hit by one rocket gun, panic and reverse full speed, only to get stuck on a building or flip over for no reason. If you get shot and cannot determine where it came from:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u2446-154">
      <li>STOP Moving</li>
     </ul>
     <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u2446-157">
      <li>Press Q in the general direction of the shot</li>
     </ul>
     <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u2446-160">
      <li>Wait for the second shot to come in</li>
     </ul>
     <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u2446-163">
      <li>Blow the idiot to kingdom come</li>
     </ul>
     <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u2446-166">
      <li>Reverse or repair</li>
     </ul>
     <p id="u2446-167">&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-169">Destroy building and towers</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Your job as a tanker is to help the infantry. Destroy all buildings you come across. Less sniper hidey hole. Less sneaky assault raining AT nades or support dropping limpets of doom on you. A building you can see in is a building you can shoot in. Give yourself line of sight on your enemies. This is really important on map like Suez or Empires Edge.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Do not get too close of building that can't be destroyed, for example in Amiens the corner buildings of the bridges near C and D can be deadly if you are too close. As a general rule, stay away from buildings and keep open space that you can monitor around your tank. The fortress in Fao fortress is another example of place where you should never go as a tank.</p>
     <p id="u2446-176">&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-178">Do not be too greedy</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>If you are holding the majority of the points of a map, your job as a tanker is to maintain control and support infantry. For example on Suez if you have E, D and C, do not push to B. Their whole team will spawn there and destroy you. Instead, stick around C and blow enemies rushing to you trying to cap C.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-185">Do not get in a position where you can't retreat easily</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Always keep a retreat path clear behind you. Do not get in a tight spot where you will get stuck while assault player rain AT nades on you. The best way to stay alive is to stay far from enemies.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-191">Do not charge full speed into a battle</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Yes I know, you are a large machine of death. But this large machine only need two mine to get blown to smithereens. When moving, try to check the ground for mines. I make an habit of going around craters because they are the best spot to hide mines. Move cautiously and look for enemy vehicles.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-197">DO NOT STAY NEAR MINES EVEN FRIENDLY ONES</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>If an enemy shoot the mines, they will damage and destroy your vehicle. To add on to this point, also do not drive on roads if you don't have to, there will probably be a sneaky mine on it that you cannot see. Instead, try and drive next to the road.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-203">Get on the points</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Nothing is more annoying that a tanks that stay really far away for the whole game, taking pot shots and not being useful. When your team move, support them. Clear the points and help capping.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-209">A captain goes down with his ship</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>As a tanker, you NEVER abandon your tank. Abandoning your tank is a possibility of an enemy jumping in, and your team losing an important asset until you kill it. When an enemy is using your tank, it won't respawn for your team until destroyed. You can jump out to repair if you are really far from the front line and there is still friendly players in the tank. But then again you shouldn't normally need to do that.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Even if your cause is lost, you can still destroy your own tank by hopping out and throwing your anti tank grenades at it (if you honestly feel like doing so though)</p>

     <p id="u2446-226">Infantry Tips to support your tanks</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Want to help your friendly tanks? Here are a couple of tips to help keeping them alive.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>As support, repair friendly tanks. When repairing, try to stay behind the vehicle. If I need to reverse quickly as a tank driver, I will be pushing you with me instead of letting you die in the middle of the field.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>As an assault, assist taking down other tanks. If you spawn on me, and I'm in a battle with another tank, consider getting out and helping. The best moment is right after the enemy tank fires. You have a couple of seconds of safety to exit and fire your rocket gun. Even a single rocket gun shot can help win an engagement.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Snipers, spot the vehicles. You often have the best vantage point of the battlefield, use it to your advantage and spot enemies vehicle.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Everyone: *Spot the vehicles and call them out in the chat*. When I'm tanking, I'm alway monitoring team chat. &quot;Heavy on C&quot; or &quot;Light going from B to D&quot; is immensely helpful if I'm coming from the spawn and need to know where to head to.</p>

     <p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>*You were probably a bit surprised when you first saw the Heavy Tank in Battlefield 1. How could you have guessed that the fast moving, funny looking, moving box of metal would become the deadliest vehicle in Battlefield 1 currently available?*</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>This thing is no joke, however. There's a good bunch of people claiming it to be overpowered. Over 40% of all vehicles kills made in Battlefield 1 are made with the Heavy Breakthrough tank, or A7V Sturmpanzer. Not only does it have the strongest armor of all the tanks in the game, it's also incredibly fast. And with machine guns or flamethrowers on all sides it's pretty much a moving fortress. Not to mention it's self-repair function and spawn capabilities.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>A Heavy Tank combined with a skilled driver can be a decisive factor in determining the outcome of a Battlefield 1 match. So how do you destroy this beastly piece of machinery? Read up on the tips &amp; tricks below and find out.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-286">BE PART OF THE SOLUTION NOT THE PROBLEM</p>
     <p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>In previous Battlefield games an enemy tank could be countered by equipping yourself with a rocket launcher or some C4. Singlehandedly taking out a tank wasn't unusual. In Battlefield 1 however, things seem to be working a little different, as the game seems to focus more on teamplay and coordination.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>With the damage per weapon, gadget or stationary being lower, it seems as though destroying an enemy tank is more about damaging it consistently and in a variety of matters. This requires a different approach. It's still possible to kill a heavy tank with one man, it's just a lot harder and takes a bit of luck.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>The main issue with Heavy Tanks at the moment is not the tank itself. They're not indestructible. The problem is team members who value their K/D ratio over playing the objective and trying to win the round. You have to realize that nobody is going to do the dirty job for you. If everyone is waiting for someone to deal with that tank, nothing is going to happen. So, the first and most important part is to..... start getting your hands dirty. You have to go handle the problem yourself.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Battlefield 1 offers several possibilities in taking care of a Heavy Tank. Here's a list of ways to deal damage to them:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>

     <p>You should also start spotting the heavy tank for friendly tankers, pilots or other team members. Make sure to keep it spotted, as the spotted icon will fade after a few seconds.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-354">WEAK SPOTS, RICOCHETS AND RANGE</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>While landships have tracks that can be destroyed, the Heavy tank has its track well hidden, thus removing the largest weak spot. The weapons that are on board however, can be destroyed and will then be rendered useless. There are a total of 6 weapons aboard the heavy tank, so make sure you aim for those. Destroying them gives you additional points.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Bullets and shells bounce off easily in Battlefield 1. When firing your AT Rocket Gun or Stationary Weapon at a poor angle, you will do close to no damage. The front armor of the heavy tank is angled, making it tougher to penetrate. You'll want to make sure you hit the tank at a 90 degree angle, preferably to the side armor. You will likely be spotted after your first shot, so be sure to make the shots count.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>When engaging a breakthrough tank, be sure to use the right weapon or gadget at the right range. For example, AT grenades are best used at close range because they will do most damage on a direct hit. AT Rocket guns are best used at medium range, since you have to be prone to use them, which makes you a sitting duck for the tank's machine guns.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-373">TIMING IS CRUCIAL</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>When it comes to taking out an enemy tank, a good timing is of the essence. The heavy tank has 6 shots available, and when they run out their reload time significantly increases. All vehicles in Battlefield 1 come with a self-repair capability and some heavy tank packages even include a quick repair gadget, making them tough to kill.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Due to these defense mechanisms, tanks will likely use their smoke screen to cover their retreat and start their recovery. This is when you and your squad strike. Doing damage to a heavy tank interrupts the repair process, which gives you an edge in finishing it off.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-388">POSITIONING MINES</p>
     <p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Heavy tanks are pretty mobile, and you can use this advantage against them by smartly using AT mines, which can be deployed by the Assault class or by Artillery Trucks. Heavy tank drivers are often so busy with firing and moving at the targets directly in front of them they forget about what's behind them, making it an ideal spot for mines. They'll likely run over them when they're retreating.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Roads, bridges and objectives also make great spots for laying down your mines. Keep in mind that heavy tanks get stuck in trenches much easier than the landships, so driver will generally try and avoid those. You can deploy up to 3 AT mines at the same time and they stay when you respawn or change classes. A heavy tank running over 3 mines will instantly kill it and everyone inside. Putting down more mines will remove the previously placed ones.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>It only takes 2 mines to kill an enemy tank. The mines also reflect sunlight, so for the least chance for it being spotted, put it in the shade or in other dark areas.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u2446-406">A TEAM EFFORT</p>
     <p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Even though killing a heavy tank can still be done singlehandedly, coordinating with your teammates will make it a lot easier. Try and keep constant pressure on the tank to prevent it from repairing or retreating. It's likely you will die at least once, so keeping one team mate alive will provide you with a close spawn point.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Also, keep a sharp eye out for tanks that are being abandoned by the enemy and any enemies retreating from it. Capturing an enemy tank allows you play the current heavy tank imbalance to your advantage, and turn the game! If you capture an enemy tank, you can drive it away, and the enemy team will lose the tank until it gets destroyed.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Good luck an happy tank hunting!</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
